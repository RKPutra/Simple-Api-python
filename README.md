Hi this is Simple REST API using ``` Flask ``` Rizky Karunia Putra

import ```database.sql``` to make a database for this API

Make sure you already installed python (i make this project with python 3.5.2), Flask, Flash Restful, Flash Mysql, and json
if you not have those, you can install following my step:
```
pip install flask
pip install flask-restful
pip install flask-mysql
pip install json
```
and then you can run ```simple_API_CRUD.py``` by command
```
python simple_API_CRUD.py
```

Then open Postman and enter ```http://127.0.0.1:5000/UserReview```
